#Object
Our project is make this open source to more realistic so it available for real rime.
1.Limit the number of room and number of people who can enter the room.
2.If you just enter the name, time, and number of people, then the program will automatically place the room according to the number of people

# RoomReservation
This program implements a reservation system for booking time in a collection of rooms.  It provides the creation and deletion of reservations (on a single day), and prints information about the overall schedule and the reservations held by a particular person. 
# Windows Compiler
This is for [Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384838.aspx) users.
# Compiling and running multiple files with clang (OSX preferred way)
1. Open Terminal 
2. cd to the directory where the project is
3. clang -c -Wall -Werror -o m main.c
4. clang -c -Wall -Werror -o r rooms.c
5. clang -c -Wall -Werror -o s schedule.c
6. clang -o Program m r s
~~To run...~~
7. ./Program
# Compiling and running multiple files with GCC (Linux)
Use gcc on OSX at your own risk.
1. Open Terminal 
2. cd to the directory where the project is
3. gcc -c -Wall -Werror -o m main.c
4. gcc -c -Wall -Werror -o r rooms.c
5. gcc -c -Wall -Werror -o s schedule.c
6. gcc -o Program m r s

# User interface and error handling
How many rooms?

Enter name (one word): //There is a chunk of code that makes sure name does not exceed 20 chars the 20 chars can be //comprimised of 
chars that are not letters so no ERROR checking for the actual characters
\
Start Time (hh:mm, 24-hr): //note: you do not need to have a 0 before a single digit hour for example 09:00 == 9:00 also if //you enter
something like Bob for the time DONT

something like Bob for the time DONT

//Also defualt opeining and closing times are 00:00 - 24:00 if you do something like

Start Time (hh:mm, 24-hr): 24:00
End Time (hh:mm, 24-hr): 25:00

//the reservation will be successful becuase there is no checking to see if the time passed is within the bounds of opening and closing
